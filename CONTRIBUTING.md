## Style guide

[![js-semistandard-style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/standard/semistandard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

This project follows JavaScript Semi-Standard Style via [`eslint-config-semistandard`](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-semistandard).

Stylesheets should follow Nicolas Gallagher's [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css#readme) principles. Additionally, element IDs and classnames should be `kebab-case`, to fit with the automatic casing of [`data-*` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*).
