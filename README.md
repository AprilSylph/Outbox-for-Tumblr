## Installation
- [Get this extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/outbox-for-tumblr/)
- [View on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oeamngjfgbhipkibmgglfdaohochpoej)

## Usage
Saving asks and answers is done passively. Open your outbox by clicking on the addon icon in the browser toolbar.

On Firefox, it is possible to save asks sent on blogs with custom domains (e.g. https://www.davidslog.com/ask) by granting "Access your data for all web sites" in the extension's permissions.
